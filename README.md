# ASTR4004/8004 Computational Astronomy - Week 7 (2024)

Welcome to the teaching repository for **Week 7** of the course **ASTR4004/8004 Computational Astronomy** at the Australian National University (ANU) in 2024. This repository contains essential materials, including Jupyter notebooks and supporting directories, for the weekâ€™s tutorial.

## Repository Contents

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **1. Preprocessing**:  
  This notebook covers some techniques for reading and preparing astronomical datasets.

- **2. Statistics**:  
  This notebook covers some statistical methods relevant to computational astronomy.

- **3. Plot Clinic**:  
  In this notebook, we explore effective data visualization techniques.

- **4. Extra: Commenting and Outsourcing Code**:  
  In this notebook, I showcase how you can better comment (for your future self and others) with *#* and DocString as well as how to outsource code.

### Directories

- **data/**:  
  Contains all datasets required for the tutorial in Week 7.

- **figures/**:  
  A directory to store figures generated during the notebooks, as well as pre-generated figures for reference.

- **latex_input/**:  
  This directory contains LaTeX files for generating scientific reports and publications using the output from the notebooks.

- **outsourced_code/**:  
  This directory contains example python functions that were outsourced from a larger file. For more information check out the *7d_code_outsourcing.ipynb.
